# Hello World
I am a learning enthusiast ever since i encountered Python.Then was impressed by certain youtubes like Dta school,and the journey began.
I am certainly not computer savvy but the Jupyter notebook prompted me to follow the Machine Learning ,Pandas,Sympy,Matplotlib,scipy,
and other libraries.Next was my journey into Latex which was partly understood.Now i am on to Github struggling to find my way in.
